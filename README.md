This project was created as one of the Front End Libraries Projects for freeCodeCamp. The requirements & objectives can be found here: https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-drum-machine

I originally built the project on Codepen: https://codepen.io/TimFau/pen/yLLMGvN

I wanted to add some additional features that would fail the JS test that FCC uses to test if the projects passes, due to linear nature of the script.  I am thus working on any future development here, and leaving the Codepen as it needs to be to pass the FCC JS script.
